<br/>
when you have downloaded a version, it will come with any dependancies it may need. you must put the dependancies in the same folder as the launcher, you should not ever put the dependancies in the version folder
<br/>
once you have done this, your folder should look something like this,
<br/>
(version name, not the jar file)
<br/>
(then your dependancies)
